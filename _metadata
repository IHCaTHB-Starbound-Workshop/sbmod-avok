The lesser avatars of Kluex act as his eyes and ears. Their bodies are part gem, part mysterious metal.

Design based on the Kluex boss. Probably the right time to confess that I've never fought him.

contains:
1 playable species
completely unique sprite
39 hair styles
11 beak styles
17 body styles (yes you read that right)
1 million color option (you read that one right too but it is a lie)

Requires a character extender!

Made with MRMT!

For the best experience use with MRMT initialization.
